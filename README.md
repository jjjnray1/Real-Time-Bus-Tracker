# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker

This is a map that will display the bus stops between MIT and Harvard.

To run just download the files place them all in the same folder and double click or drag the html link into the browser and it should load the map and have a button at the top, press the button to show all the stop between MIT and Harvard.

In the future I want to add realtime tracking and show where the bus is currently.
